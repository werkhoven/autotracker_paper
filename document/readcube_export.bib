  abstract={Modern neuroscience and the interest in biomimetic control design demand increasingly sophisticated experimental techniques that can be applied in freely moving animals under realistic behavioral conditions. To explore sensorimotor flight control mechanisms in free-flying fruit flies {(Drosophila} melanogaster), we equipped a wind tunnel with a Virtual Reality {(VR)} display system based on standard digital hardware and a {3D} path tracking system. We demonstrate the experimental power of this approach by example of a ‘one-parameter open loop’ testing paradigm. It provided (1) a straightforward measure of transient responses in presence of open loop visual stimulation; (2) high data throughput and standardized measurement conditions from process automation; and (3) simplified data analysis due to well-defined testing {conditions.Being} based on standard hardware and software techniques, our methods provide an affordable, easy to replicate and general solution for a broad range of behavioral applications in freely moving animals. Particular relevance for advanced behavioral research tools originates from the need to perform detailed behavioral analyses in genetically modified organisms and animal models for disease research.},

  abstract={Quantitative genetics has primarily focused on describing genetic effects on trait means and largely ignored the effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, potentially missing an important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences among individuals. To study the genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used Drosophila inbred lines and measured the spontaneous locomotor behavior of flies walking individually in Y-shaped mazes, focusing on variability in locomotor handedness, an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals, whereas lines with low variability behaved as although they tossed a coin at each left/right turn decision. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study {(GWAS)} for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicates a neuropil in the central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination. We validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible {RNAi} transgenes. Our study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variabililty. Because traditional mean-focused {GWASs} ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype.},

  abstract={Machine vision systems have been designed for automated monitoring and analysis of social behavior in Drosophila by Herko Dankert. The Ctrax {(The} Caltech Multiple Fly Tracker) is implemented for tracking the Drosophila's movement. But the machine vision method is so sophisticated that it is hard to use by a researcher who is lack of computer technology knowledge. Likewise, most of the machine vision solutions are poor performance for the real time environment. Our work focuses on developing a high-performance application to track moving Drosophila and generate reliable tracks from the video. A light solution to automatically tracking the Drosophila in video is implemented, based on object motion in different parts of the scene. The results of effect tests show that our solution tackles the questions of performance, usability and accuracy in machine vision for bioresearch.},

  abstract={Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila, or Caenorhabditis elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called {‘FlyPi’.} Our design is based on a {3D-printed} mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, {FlyPi} can be assembled for well under €100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode {(LED)-based} fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately €200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to ‘shop around’. All functions of {FlyPi} can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate {FlyPi’s} capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate {FlyPi’s} utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of {FlyPi} make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs.},

  abstract={We designed a real-time computer vision system, the {Multi-Worm} Tracker {(MWT),} which can simultaneously quantify the behavior of dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans on a Petri plate at video rates. We examined three traditional behavioral paradigms using this system: spontaneous movement on food, where the behavior changes over tens of minutes; chemotaxis, where turning events must be detected accurately to determine strategy; and habituation of response to tap, where the response is stochastic and changes over time. In each case, manual analysis or automated single-worm tracking would be tedious and time-consuming, but the {MWT} system allowed rapid quantification of behavior with minimal human effort. Thus, this system will enable large-scale forward and reverse genetic screens for complex behaviors.},
